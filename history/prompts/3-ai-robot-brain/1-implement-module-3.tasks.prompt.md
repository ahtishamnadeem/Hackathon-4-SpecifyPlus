## Prompt

Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (Docusaurus) Target audience: AI and robotics students advancing into perception, navigation, and AI-driven humanoid control Focus: Implementing advanced AI capabilities in humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac™ and ROS-based tools Chapters (Docusaurus): 1. Photorealistic Simulation with NVIDIA Isaac Sim - Synthetic data generation and high-fidelity environments 2. Hardware-Accelerated AI with Isaac ROS - VSLAM, perception, and navigation pipelines 3. Path Planning with Nav2 - Bipedal humanoid movement and navigation strategies

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain with all three chapters:
1. Photorealistic Simulation with NVIDIA Isaac Sim
2. Hardware-Accelerated AI with Isaac ROS
3. Path Planning with Nav2 for Humanoid Robots

Created comprehensive educational content with learning objectives, practical examples, code snippets, and proper Docusaurus formatting. Updated navigation in sidebars.js and README.md to include the new module.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation of Module 3 with 3 comprehensive chapters covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 6 files created/modified including 3 chapter files, index, navigation, and README
- 🔁 Next prompts: Review and validation of Module 3 content
- 🧠 Reflection: Content successfully covers advanced AI capabilities for humanoid robots with practical examples

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Review content accuracy against official documentation
