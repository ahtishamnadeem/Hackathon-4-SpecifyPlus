# Project Setup and Run Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Node.js and npm installed

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Start the Backend Server
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory, then:

```
cd backend
python -m uvicorn integration_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Build and Serve the Frontend
In a new terminal/command prompt (while keeping the backend running), navigate to your project directory and run:

```
npx docusaurus build
npx serve -s build -l 3002
```

### 3. Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3002
- Backend Health Check: http://localhost:8000/chat/health

### 4. Using the Floating Chat Widget
1. Visit http://localhost:3002 in your browser
2. Look for the chat icon at the bottom-right corner of any page
3. Click the icon to open the floating chat widget
4. Type your questions and interact with the RAG agent
5. You can select text from the documentation to provide context
6. Click the X button or the chat icon again to close the widget

## Alternative Method (Development Mode)
If you prefer running in development mode:
1. After building, instead of npx serve, you can use:
```
npx docusaurus serve --port 3002
```

## Troubleshooting
- If port 8000 or 3002 is already in use, you may need to kill existing processes or use different ports
- Make sure both servers are running simultaneously for full functionality
- The backend server handles all API requests for the chat widget
- The frontend serves the Docusaurus documentation with the floating chat widget

The floating chat widget will be available on every page of the documentation site, providing seamless access to the RAG agent without leaving your current page.
