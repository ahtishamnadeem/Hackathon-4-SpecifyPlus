# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to Module 1 of the ROS 2 Fundamentals course! This module introduces you to ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system for humanoid control, communication, and embodiment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of ROS 2 in Physical AI and humanoid robotics
- Use rclpy to build ROS 2 nodes that interface with Python AI agents
- Create URDF models with proper links, joints, and coordinate frames
- Implement publishers, subscribers, services, and actions in ROS 2
- Prepare humanoid robots for simulation and control

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts
- Interest in robotics and AI

## Chapters

This module is divided into three comprehensive chapters:

### [1. Introduction to ROS 2 and Robotic Middleware](./intro-to-ros2.md)
Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system for humanoid control, communication, and embodiment. Understand core concepts like nodes, topics, services, and message passing, as well as real-time constraints and DDS concepts.

### [2. Python Agents and ROS 2 Control](./python-agents-ros2.md)
Learn how to bridge Python AI agents to robot controllers using ROS 2. Master using rclpy to build ROS 2 nodes, and create publishers, subscribers, services, and actions that connect Python AI agents to robot controllers.

### [3. Humanoid Robot Modeling with URDF](./humanoid-urdf-modeling.md)
Learn how to model humanoid robots using URDF for simulation and control. Understand the purpose of URDF in humanoid robots and how to create models with proper links, joints, sensors, and coordinate frames.

## Getting Started

Start with the [Introduction to ROS 2 and Robotic Middleware](./intro-to-ros2.md) chapter to build a solid foundation in ROS 2 concepts. Each chapter builds on the previous one, but they are designed to be independently testable and comprehensive.

## Resources

- [ROS 2 Official Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/)
- [Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [rclpy API Documentation](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/rclpy/)

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you will have a solid understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals and be ready to explore more advanced topics in Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
