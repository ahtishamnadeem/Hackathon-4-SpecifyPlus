# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain

Welcome to Module 3 of the ROS 2 Fundamentals course! This module focuses on advanced AI capabilities in humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac and ROS-based tools. You'll learn how to create digital twins that simulate humanoid robot behavior, appearance, and sensor data in real-time.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and implementation of AI-driven robotic systems for humanoid robots
- Configure photorealistic simulation environments using NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation
- Implement hardware-accelerated AI processing using Isaac ROS for real-time perception and navigation
- Adapt navigation systems (Nav2) for bipedal humanoid movement and stability requirements
- Integrate digital twin simulations with ROS 2 systems for comprehensive testing and development

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals) and Module 2 (Digital Twin concepts)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (gravity, collisions, dynamics)
- Familiarity with 3D environments and rendering concepts
- Understanding of sensor types and their applications in robotics
- Experience with GPU computing and CUDA basics

## Chapters

This module is divided into three comprehensive chapters:

### [1. Photorealistic Simulation with Isaac Sim](./photorealistic-simulation-isaac-sim)
Learn how to create photorealistic simulation environments using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, including synthetic data generation and high-fidelity environments. Understand how to configure realistic physics, lighting, and rendering for training perception algorithms.

### [2. Hardware-Accelerated AI with Isaac ROS](./hardware-accelerated-ai-isaac-ros)
Explore how to leverage Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated AI processing, including VSLAM, perception, and navigation pipelines that utilize NVIDIA GPU acceleration for real-time performance in humanoid robots.

### [3. Path Planning with Nav2 for Humanoid Robots](./path-planning-nav2)
Understand how to adapt Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement and navigation strategies, considering the unique challenges of humanoid locomotion compared to traditional wheeled navigation systems.

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Photorealistic Simulation with Isaac Sim](./photorealistic-simulation-isaac-sim) chapter to establish the foundation of your AI-robot brain system. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, but they are designed to be independently testable and comprehensive.
