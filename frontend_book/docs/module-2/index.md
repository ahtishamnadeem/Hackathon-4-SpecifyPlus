# Module 2: The Digital Twin

Welcome to Module 2 of the ROS 2 Fundamentals course! This module introduces you to digital twins for humanoid robots using physics-based and interactive simulations. You'll learn how to create virtual representations of physical robots that simulate their behavior, appearance, and sensor data in real-time.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept and architecture of digital twins in robotics
- Configure physics simulation environments using Gazebo for realistic robot dynamics
- Create high-fidelity environments with Unity for rendering and human-robot interaction
- Implement sensor simulation that produces realistic data for LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Integrate digital twin simulations with ROS 2 systems for testing and development

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (gravity, collisions, dynamics)
- Familiarity with 3D environments and rendering concepts
- Understanding of sensor types and their applications in robotics

## Chapters

This module is divided into three comprehensive chapters:

### [1. Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation-gazebo)
Learn how to create physics simulation environments using Gazebo, including configuring gravity, collision detection, and robot dynamics for realistic humanoid robot behavior. Understand how to set up simulation worlds that accurately reflect real-world physics.

### [2. High-Fidelity Environments with Unity](./high-fidelity-unity)
Explore how to create high-fidelity environments using Unity for realistic rendering and human-robot interaction. Learn about visualization techniques, lighting, and creating immersive environments for digital twin applications.

### [3. Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation)
Understand how to simulate various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs to generate realistic sensor data for testing perception algorithms and navigation systems.

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation-gazebo) chapter to establish the foundation of your digital twin system. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, but they are designed to be independently testable and comprehensive.
